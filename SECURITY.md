# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue

To report a security issue, please email
[scala.center@epfl.ch](mailto:scala.center@epfl.ch) with a description of the
issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known,
mitigations for the issue. The Security Team will attempt to respond within a
reasonable timeframe to your email. If the issue is confirmed as a
vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory.

## Procedure

1. A GitHub Security Advisory will be created in the appropriate repository.
2. A project member works privately with the reporter to resolve the vulnerability.
3. The project creates a new release of the package the vulnerability affects to deliver its fix.
4. The project publicly announces the vulnerability and describes how to apply the fix.

## Scala Steward

We strongly recommend users of our libraries to use [Scala
Steward](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward) or something
similar to automatically receive updates.
